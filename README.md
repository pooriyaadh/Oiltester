This project is about communicate beetween the main board and lcd tft by rs485 protocol.
This project for just receiving data from lcd tft I don't upload the source code of lcd In this case.

In This project I used stm32f030c8 microcontroller.
In this project I use Structures for give a name to my variables in code I think this is so good because you should only make INIT and  HANDLER functions in your files.
If you have any question about this project or  you find any problems ,I'm be happy if you tell me:) .
